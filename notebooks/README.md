In order for the script to work, you must do these steps.

1. Extract the zip file into any folder you like.

2. Open a command prompt or terminal and install these modules:- (You need to have python and pip installed) 
    pip install pandas
    pip install sqlalchemy.

3. Need to have a working MySQL server. Specifically you need:-
    
    database = "demo"
    host = "localhost"
    username = "root"
    password = ""

Configure these changes in the ETL-script.py file.
