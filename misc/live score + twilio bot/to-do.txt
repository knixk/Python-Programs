# Defining the project requirements

It is a good idea to list down the features/requirements of our SMS bot. We want
it to be able to respond to five different kinds of messages:

• “today” should return the details of all games happening today
• “tomorrow” should return the details of all games happening tomorrow
• “complete” should return the complete group stage details
• A country code (like “BRA” for Brazil) should return information related to
that particular country
• “list” should return all of the FIFA country codes
